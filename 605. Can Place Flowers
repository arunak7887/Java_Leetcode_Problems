605. Can Place Flowers

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.
Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
Constraints:
1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

Code :

class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] arr, int x) {
        int n=arr.length;
        int count=0;
        if(n==0){
            return false;
        }
        else if(n==1){
            if(arr[0]==0&&x<=1){
                return true;
            }
            else if(arr[0]==1&&x==0){
                return true;
            }
            else{
                return false;
            }
        }
        else{
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(i==0){
                    if(arr[i]==0&&arr[i+1]==0){
                        arr[i]=1;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                else if(i>0&&i<n-1){
                    if(arr[i]==0&&arr[i-1]==0&&arr[i+1]==0){
                        arr[i]=1;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    if(arr[i]==0&&arr[i-1]==0){
                        arr[i]=1;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                
            }
        }
        
        if(count>=x)
        return true;

        return false;
    }
}

Explanation:

The method starts by checking the length of the array arr.
It initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of flowers placed.
If the array is empty (n == 0), it returns false.
If the array has only one element (n == 1), it checks if the single element is either 0 or 1 and if the number of flowers to place (x) allows placing a flower, then returns true.
Otherwise, it iterates through the flowerbed array arr.
It checks each position to see if it's possible to place a flower according to the given condition (no adjacent flowers).
It updates the count variable whenever a flower is successfully placed.
Finally, it checks if the count of placed flowers is greater than or equal to the required number of flowers (x). If so, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
